This is the debugging info:
```
The best guess to fix this error would be to reformat the code properly by adding proper indentation to each line and removing any unnecessary characters, such as the extra quotation marks and brackets at the end. The HTML code also needs to be properly closed with corresponding tags.```

The error is occurring because the price value in the HTML snippet contains a special character ("Â£") that cannot be converted to float. To fix this, we can modify the code to remove the special character before converting the price value to float. The updated code could look something like this:

```
price = float(info.find('p', class_='price_color').text.strip("£").replace("Â",""))```

This uses the `.replace()` function to replace the special character with an empty string, effectively removing it from the string. The resulting string can then be converted to a float without any errors.

- Use `.strip()` to remove any white spaces or unwanted characters from the `info.find('p', class_='price_color').text` before trying to convert it to a float.

2023-11-12 14:49:08,142 - ERROR - Debugging info (Attempt 6):

Possible fix:

To fix this error, you can try initializing the 'price' variable before the try/except block with a placeholder value like None, and then update the value inside the try block. This way, the variable will have a value assigned before it is referenced.

Example:

```
        # extract price
        price = None 
        try:
            price = float(info.find('p', class_='price_color').text.strip("£").replace("Â",""))
        except ValueError:
            print("Unable to convert price to float for book", title)
        ```

Also, make sure to handle the scenario where the try block fails and price remains None, so that the code doesn't break while trying to use the price variable.

The code should take in this link `https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/index.html` and PRINT out the requested data.
Generate only the code, not any example usages or output, and you MUST wrap your answer in a markdown code block.
Generate it in this format.
```python
# imports
import bs4 

def scraper(url: str) -> str:
  # scraper logic goes here
  pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
  url = "<DUMMY URL, REPLACE WITH ACTUAL URL>"
  scraper(url)
START CONTEXT
This is the debugging info:
```
Possible fix:

To fix this error, you can try initializing the 'price' variable before the try/except block with a placeholder value like None, and then update the value inside the try block. This way, the variable will have a value assigned before it is referenced.

Example:

```
        # extract price
        price = None 
        try:
            price = float(info.find('p', class_='price_color').text.strip("£").replace("Â",""))
        except ValueError:
            print("Unable to convert price to float for book", title)
        ```

Also, make sure to handle the scenario where the try block fails and price remains None, so that the code doesn't break while trying to use the price variable. ```
This is your previous error:
```Error on line 40:             "price": price, 
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'price' referenced before assignment```
This is your previous code:
```python
# imports
import bs4 
import json
import requests

def scraper(url: str) -> str:
    # create an empty dictionary
    books = []
    
    # make a request to the url using bs4
    source = bs4.BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).text, 'lxml')
    
    # select the section containing all book information
    books_info = source.find_all('article', class_='product_pod')
    
    # loop through each book information
    for info in books_info:
        # extract title

The code should take in this link `https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/index.html` and PRINT out the requested data.
Generate only the code, not any example usages or output, and you MUST wrap your answer in a markdown code block.
Generate it in this format.

This is the debugging info:
```                        

The best guess for fixing this error is to make sure that all the lines in the code snippet have the same level of indentation. This includes both the "title" and "price" lines in the `book` dictionary, as well as the `books.append(book)` line.```
This is your previous error:
```Error on line 17:             books.append(book)
IndentationError: unexpected indent (<string>, line 2)```
This is your previous code:
```python
# extract price
        price = None 
        try:
            price = float(info.find('p', class_='price_color').text.strip("£").replace("Â",""))
        except ValueError:
            print("Unable to convert price to float for book", title)
        
        # check if price is still None
        if price is not None:
            # create a dictionary for each book and append to books list
