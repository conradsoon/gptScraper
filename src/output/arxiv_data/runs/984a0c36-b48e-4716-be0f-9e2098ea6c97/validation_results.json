We answer this question by investigating LMs' more subtle judgments associated with \\\"language illusions\\\" -- sentences that are vague in meaning, implausible, or ungrammatical but receive unexpectedly high acceptability judgments by humans. We looked at three illusions: the comparative illusion (e.g. \\\"More people have been to Russia than I have\\\"), the depth-charge illusion (e.g. \\\"No head injury is too trivial to be ignored\\\"), and the negative polarity item (NPI) illusion (e.g. \\\"The hunter who no villager believed to be trustworthy will ever shoot a bear\\\"). We found that probabilities represented by LMs were more likely to align with human judgments of being \\\"tricked\\\" by the NPI illusion which examines a structural dependency, compared to the comparative and the depth-charge illusions which require sophisticated semantic understanding. No single LM or metric yielded results that are entirely consistent with human behavior.

By testing both model performance on multiple out-of-domain test sets and individual data point efficacy, our results show that while manual CADs are still the most effective, CADs generated by ChatGPT come a close second.

Challenges encompassed data scarcity, linguistic diversity, and domain-specific content. This paper presents lessons learned while crawling and refining data tailored for fine-tuning Vietnamese language models. Crafting such a dataset, while accounting for linguistic intricacies and striking a balance between inclusivity and accuracy, demands meticulous planning. Our paper presents a multidimensional strategy including leveraging existing datasets in the English language and developing customized data-crawling scripts with the assistance of generative AI tools. A fine-tuned LLM model for the Vietnamese language, which was produced using resultant datasets, demonstrated good performance while generating Vietnamese news articles from prompts. The study offers practical solutions and guidance for future fine-tuning models in languages like Vietnamese.\"\n}\n",

However, these models are not flawless and often produce responses that contain errors or misinformation. These inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations, render LLMs unreliable and even unusable in many scenarios. In this paper, our focus is on mitigating the issue of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in the context of question-answering. Instead of attempting to answer all questions, we explore a refusal mechanism that instructs LLMs to refuse to answer challenging questions in order to avoid errors. We then propose a simple yet effective solution called Learn to Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the refusal mechanism to enable LLMs to recognize and refuse to answer questions that they find difficult to address. To achieve this, we utilize a structured knowledge base to represent all the LLM's understanding of the world, enabling it to provide traceable gold knowledge. This knowledge base is separate from the LLM and initially empty, and it is progressively expanded with validated knowledge. When an LLM encounters questions outside its domain, the system recognizes its knowledge scope and determines whether it can answer the question independently. Additionally, we introduce a method for automatically and efficiently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the controllability and reliability of LLMs.\"\n}\n",

However, although people use natural language to reason effectively, it may be that LMs could reason more effectively with some intermediate computation that is not in natural language. In this work, we explore an alternative reasoning approach: instead of explicitly producing the chain of thought reasoning steps, we use the language model's internal hidden states to perform implicit reasoning. The implicit reasoning steps are distilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, and instead of doing reasoning \\\"horizontally\\\" by producing intermediate words one-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens \\\"vertically\\\" among the hidden states in different layers. We conduct experiments on a multi-digit multiplication task and a grade school math problem dataset and find that this approach enables solving tasks previously not solvable without explicit chain-of-thought, at a speed comparable to no chain-of-thought.\"\n}\n",
