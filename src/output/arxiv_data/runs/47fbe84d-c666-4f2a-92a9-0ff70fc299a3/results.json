Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require \\\"reading the tea leaves\\\" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT is a general-purpose topic modeling framework that offers several benefits. First, we demonstrate that TopicGPT can recover accurate, interpretable topics that are competitive with LDA's. Second, TopicGPT allows users to control the semantics of topics via prompts, which promote topic diversity and facilitate downstream applications. Finally, TopicGPT is robust to data sparsity and flexible in handling previously unseen words, two problems that hinder the popular variational auto-encoder based topic models.\"}",
