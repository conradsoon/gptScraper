<meta property="og:description" content="Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require &#34;reading the tea leaves&#34; to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling."/>

<meta content='Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require "reading the tea leaves" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.' property="og:description"/>

Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require "reading the tea leaves" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.' name="citation_abstract"/>

<span class="descriptor">Abstract:</span>Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require "reading the tea leaves" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.

<span class="descriptor">Abstract:</span>Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require "reading the tea leaves" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.

<span class="descriptor">Abstract:</span>Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require "reading the tea leaves" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model ret```

One best guess to fix this error is to add a check for None before trying to access the 'content' attribute. This can be done by using the `.get()` function instead of directly accessing the attribute with `['content']`. 
Example:
```
authors = soup.find('meta', property='citation_author').get('content')

This will return `None` if the attribute is not found, instead of throwing an error. Then, you can handle this `None` value in your code to avoid the error.

This is the debugging info:
```One possible solution could be to add a validation step to check if the 'citation_author' property is present before attempting to retrieve the 'content' attribute. This can prevent the code from attempting to retrieve an attribute from a Nonetype object if the property is not present on the page. The updated code could look like this:

```python
# imports
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json

def scraper(url: str) -> str:
    # Send a GET request to the given url and store the response
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Extract the HTML content from the response
        html_content = response.content

        # Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

        # Extract the necessary elements using the class and id attributes
        paper_title = soup.find('meta', property='og:title')['content']
        # add a validation step for citation_author property
        if soup.find('meta', property='citation_author'):
            authors = soup.find('meta', property='citation_author').get('content')
        else:
            authors = "N/A"
        abstract = soup.find('meta', property='og:description')['content']

        # Create a dictionary to store the extracted data
        data = {
            'paper_title': paper_title,
            'authors': authors,

if __name__ == '__main__':
    url = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01449"

This way, even if the 'citation_author' property is not present on the page, the program will still be able to retrieve the other information and print a default value for the authors.```

  "abstract": "\nAbstract:Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require \"reading the tea leaves\" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal semantic control over topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics within a provided text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: for example, it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. TopicGPT can be further extended to hierarchical topical modeling, enabling users to explore topics at various levels of granularity. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.\n    "

We answer this question by investigating LMs' more subtle judgments associated with \"language illusions\" -- sentences that are vague in meaning, implausible, or ungrammatical but receive unexpectedly high acceptability judgments by humans. We looked at three illusions: the comparative illusion (e.g. \"More people have been to Russia than I have\"), the depth-charge illusion (e.g. \"No head injury is too trivial to be ignored\"), and the negative polarity item (NPI) illusion (e.g. \"The hunter who no villager believed to be trustworthy will ever shoot a bear\"). We found that probabilities represented by LMs were more likely to align with human judgments of being \"tricked\" by the NPI illusion which examines a structural dependency, compared to the comparative and the depth-charge illusions which require sophisticated semantic understanding. No single LM or metric yielded results that are entirely consistent with human behavior.

An important part of cognitive state is the common ground, which is the content the speaker believes, and the speaker believes the audience believes, and so on. While much attention has been paid to common ground in cognitive science, there has not been much work in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a new annotation and corpus to capture common ground. We then describe some initial experiments extracting propositions from dialog and tracking their status in the common ground from the perspective of each speaker.\\n    "\n}\n', 'verifier_response': '\nYES'}

Many neural network approaches have been applied to the construction of Chinese input method engines(IMEs).Previous research often assumed that the input pinyin was correct and focused on Pinyin-to-character(P2C) task, which significantly falls short of meeting users' demands. Moreover, previous research could not leverage user feedback to optimize the model and provide personalized results. In this study, we propose a novel Generative Input paradigm named GeneInput. It uses prompts to handle all input scenarios and other intelligent auxiliary input functions, optimizing the model with user feedback to deliver personalized results. The results demonstrate that we have achieved state-of-the-art performance for the first time in the Full-mode Key-sequence to Characters(FK2C) task. We propose a novel reward model training method that eliminates the need for additional manual annotations and the performance surpasses GPT-4 in tasks involving intelligent association and conversational assistance. Compared to traditional paradigms, GeneInput not only demonstrates superior performance but also exhibits enhanced robustness, scalability, and online learning capabilities.\n    "

However, its application in the field of input methods remains under-explored. Many neural network approaches have been applied to the construction of Chinese input method engines(IMEs).Previous research often assumed that the input pinyin was correct and focused on Pinyin-to-character(P2C) task, which significantly falls short of meeting users\' demands. Moreover, previous research could not leverage user feedback to optimize the model and provide personalized results. In this study, we propose a novel Generative Input paradigm named GeneInput. It uses prompts to handle all input scenarios and other intelligent auxiliary input functions, optimizing the model with user feedback to deliver personalized results. The results demonstrate that we have achieved state-of-the-art performance for the first time in the Full-mode Key-sequence to Characters(FK2C) task. We propose a novel reward model training method that eliminates the need for additional manual annotations and the performance surpasses GPT-4 in tasks involving intelligent association and conversational assistance. Compared to traditional paradigms, GeneInput not only demonstrates superior performance but also exhibits enhanced robustness, scalability, and online learning capabilities.\\n    "\n}\n', 'verifier_response': '\n\n \nYES\n\nExplanation:\nThe output snippet accurately fulfills the requirements based on the prompt.

To accelerate the research of LLMs, several large-scale datasets, such as C4 [1], Pile [2], RefinedWeb [3] and WanJuan [4], have been released to the public. However, most of the released corpus focus mainly on English, and there is still lack of complete tool-chain for extracting clean texts from web data. Furthermore, fine-grained information of the corpus, e.g. the quality of each text, is missing. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a new complete tool-chain EvalWeb to extract Chinese clean texts from noisy web data. First, similar to previous work, manually crafted rules are employed to discard explicit noisy texts from the raw crawled web contents. Second, a well-designed evaluation model is leveraged to assess the remaining relatively clean data, and each text is assigned a specific quality score. Finally, we can easily utilize an appropriate threshold to select the high-quality pre-training data for Chinese. Using our proposed approach, we release the largest and latest large-scale high-quality Chinese web text ChineseWebText, which consists of 1.42 TB and each text is associated with a quality score, facilitating the LLM researchers to choose the data according to the desired quality thresholds. We also release a much cleaner subset of 600 GB Chinese data with the quality exceeding 90%.\n    "

To accelerate the research of LLMs, several large-scale datasets, such as C4 [1], Pile [2], RefinedWeb [3] and WanJuan [4], have been released to the public. However, most of the released corpus focus mainly on English, and there is still lack of complete tool-chain for extracting clean texts from web data. Furthermore, fine-grained information of the corpus, e.g. the quality of each text, is missing. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a new complete tool-chain EvalWeb to extract Chinese clean texts from noisy web data. First, similar to previous work, manually crafted rules are employed to discard explicit noisy texts from the raw crawled web contents. Second, a well-designed evaluation model is leveraged to assess the remaining relatively clean data, and each text is assigned a specific quality score. Finally, we can easily utilize an appropriate threshold to select the high-quality pre-training data for Chinese. Using our proposed approach, we release the largest and latest large-scale high-quality Chinese web text ChineseWebText, which consists of 1.42 TB and each text is associated with a quality score, facilitating the LLM researchers to choose the data according to the desired quality thresholds. We also release a much cleaner subset of 600 GB Chinese data with the quality exceeding 90%.\\n    "\n}\n', 'verifier_response': '\n\nYES'}

However, although people use natural language to reason effectively, it may be that LMs could reason more effectively with some intermediate computation that is not in natural language. In this work, we explore an alternative reasoning approach: instead of explicitly producing the chain of thought reasoning steps, we use the language model's internal hidden states to perform implicit reasoning. The implicit reasoning steps are distilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, and instead of doing reasoning \"horizontally\" by producing intermediate words one-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens \"vertically\" among the hidden states in different layers. We conduct experiments on a multi-digit multiplication task and a grade school math problem dataset and find that this approach enables solving tasks previously not solvable without explicit chain-of-thought, at a speed comparable to no chain-of-thought.\n    "

However, although people use natural language to reason effectively, it may be that LMs could reason more effectively with some intermediate computation that is not in natural language. In this work, we explore an alternative reasoning approach: instead of explicitly producing the chain of thought reasoning steps, we use the language model\'s internal hidden states to perform implicit reasoning. The implicit reasoning steps are distilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, and instead of doing reasoning \\"horizontally\\" by producing intermediate words one-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens \\"vertically\\" among the hidden states in different layers. We conduct experiments on a multi-digit multiplication task and a grade school math problem dataset and find that this approach enables solving tasks previously not solvable without explicit chain-of-thought, at a speed comparable to no chain-of-thought.\\n    "\n}\n', 'verifier_response': '\n\nThe output appears to accurately fulfill the requirements by extracting the paper title, authors, and abstract from the research papers on the page.
